                There is so much I need to say to you, and I hope you can find it in your heart to listen to my words.

                I want to start by saying how deeply sorry I am for everything that has happened between us recently. I already read and I realized how my actions and words have hurt you, and seeing your smile fade because of me breaks my heart. Please believe me when I say that hurting you was never my intention, and I regret every moment where I've caused you pain.
                
                I understand why you've felt neglected or unloved at times, and I want you to know that I am truly sorry for not being more attentive and understanding. I always said your feelings are important but I made at you and making your emotions like crap and I making it to me that im hurting because of you. I should not ever done that to you sayang, I am really messep up everything. You deserve better than the misunderstandings and arguments that have plagued us recently. You needed me, and I wasn't there. I failed you when you needed support the most.
                
                I selfish, I acted like i dun think about your emotion and hurt you. I understand now that this was wrong. I see how much you have been struggling to save our relationship. I can give up anything in life, but I can never give up on us. I should have never let my anger dictate my actions. I failed to love you properly, betrayed all my promises, and consistently made you feel bad. I was careless with your emotions and desires.
                
                I am  admit that I have been the worst boyfriend for you. The way I making you like you were nothing to me. I realized now that no matter what youre my love and i accept you for who you're, I see now how deeply my actions have wounded you. I want to change; I want to be better. I want to be the partner you deserve. Give me a chance to make things right, Im working on it now sayang.
                
                I know it will take time and effort to earn back your trust, but I am committed to making things right. You deserve all the love and happiness in the world, and I am determined to be the person who can provide that for you.
                
                Please forgive me, my love. I am truly sorry for everything.</p>
